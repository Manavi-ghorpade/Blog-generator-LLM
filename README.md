# Blog-generator-LLM

Welcome to the Blog Generator using LLAMA-2 model! This project utilizes the LLAMA-2 model, an open-source model from Meta, to generate blog content. Additionally, we have designed a user-friendly front-end using Streamlit.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the application:

1. **Download Conda**: If you haven't already, download and install Conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

2. **Create Conda Environment**: Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new Conda environment using the following command:

    ```bash
    conda create -p venv python==3.9 --y
    ```

    This command will create a new environment named "venv" with Python version 3.9.

3. **Activate Environment**: Activate the newly created environment by running:

    ```bash
    conda activate venv
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will download and install all the necessary packages for the project.

5. **Run the Application**: Start the project by running the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This command will launch the Streamlit application, allowing you to generate blog content using the LLAMA-2 model.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the user interface to generate blog content. Explore the different options and parameters provided to customize the generated content according to your preferences.
